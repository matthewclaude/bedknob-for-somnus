/*
 * Firmware updates from GitHub Releases (M6): the version check hits the
 * public repo's GitHub API (api.github.com), and the image itself is
 * esp_https_ota'd from the release's "orion-dial.bin" asset (a 302 to
 * objects.githubusercontent.com, which esp_https_ota follows natively). TLS
 * on both hosts verifies against an embedded multi-root PEM (trust_roots.pem,
 * EMBED_TXTFILES -- see dial_ota.c) curated to survive a routine CA rotation
 * on either host without bricking OTA. This bundle used to be shared with
 * dial_oauth/dial_mcp (the Orion cloud client, now removed along with the
 * rest of that pipeline -- see components/dial_somnus); dial_ota is its only
 * remaining consumer, so the anchors now live here directly.
 *
 * Beta channel: dial_ota_check(beta) takes the caller's current
 * dial_state.beta preference (SCR_UPDATE's "Beta builds" toggle). Off, this
 * is exactly today's behavior. On, it queries the releases LIST endpoint
 * instead of /releases/latest (which by definition excludes prereleases)
 * and picks the newest by version among the entries it inspects, tags like
 * "dial-v1.1.0-beta.1" included -- see is_newer()'s semver §11 prerelease
 * tiebreak in the .c file.
 *
 * Threading: dial_ota_check/download_and_apply are blocking and worker-task
 * only. dial_ota_get() is a mutex-guarded snapshot safe to call from any task
 * (mirrors dial_state_get, so the LVGL-side settings screen can read progress
 * without touching the worker directly -- though in practice the worker
 * mirrors this into app_state_t and screens read that instead).
