/*
 * Display power / standby manager: idle-driven backlight dimming with LEDC
 * hardware fades, plus the wake-consumes-first-input rule.
 *
 * Levels (day / night duty targets):
 *   ACTIVE  — full brightness, user interacting or recently active
 *   DIMMED  — legible-but-quiet after ~a third of the screen timeout below
 *   STANDBY — near-dark after the user's "Screen timeout" preference (the
 *             lock/standby idle threshold, Settings' "Screen timeout" row —
 *             see dial_state_get_screen_timeout_s); the router should be
 *             showing the standby face by then (it follows the same idle
 *             clock)
 *
 * Wake rule: when the display is in STANDBY, the first touch or detent must
 * wake the screen and DO NOTHING ELSE (a 3am reach must not change the
 * temperature). Input handlers call dial_power_wake_consumes() first and
 * drop the event if it returns true.

// picker is actually editing — DPWR_ACTIVE for the Day/Night brightness
// pickers (the screen is by definition in front of the user while they're
// dialing this in, so ACTIVE is what they'd otherwise be looking at), and
// DPWR_STANDBY for the Night Clock picker (bri_night_clock_pct governs ONLY
// the night standby/screensaver duty, so previewing ACTIVE there would show
// the wrong — much brighter — glow). Call again on every knob detent to
// update the live value; each call also forces a reapply so the fade starts
// within one tick. dial_power_preview_end() clears the override (also
// forcing a reapply back to the normal level duty) — screens MUST call it
// when edit mode ends, including on teardown, or the override sticks
// forever.
// Percent -> duty for the NIGHT standby clock (0 = off, 100 = brightest),

// of the range. Exposed because dial_state's migration inverts it to seed
// the pref at the duty this firmware used before the setting existed.
