# firmware/

- **[`dial-idf/`](dial-idf/)** — the firmware. Native ESP-IDF (C) for the
  Waveshare ESP32-S3-Knob-Touch-LCD-1.8 dial: Wi-Fi setup, a local HTTP
  client for the Somnus Pad, subnet scan to find the pad, the UI and
  over-the-air updates, all on-device. See
  [`dial-idf/README.md`](dial-idf/README.md) to build and flash.
- **[`backups/`](backups/)** — local-only flash dumps of specific physical
  units (companion-chip factory image, etc.), for restoring a unit to its
  out-of-box state. The `.bin` files are gitignored; only the README here is
  tracked. Not needed to build or run the product.

## Board facts

| Part | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Board | **Waveshare ESP32-S3-Knob-Touch-LCD-1.8** (Guition JC3636K518) |
| MCU | ESP32-S3R8 (8 MB PSRAM, 16 MB flash) + companion ESP32-U4WDH |
| Display | 1.8" **round** 360×360 panel over **QSPI**, driven by the **SH8601** command set (`esp_lcd_sh8601`), LVGL |
| Display pins | CS=14, CLK=13, DATA=15/16/17/18, RST=21, backlight (PWM)=47 |
| Rotary encoder | incremental A/B quadrature: **pin_a=GPIO8, pin_b=GPIO7** (not magnetic; only live under full board init) |
| Knob click | **none** — GPIO0 is the boot button; use a touchscreen **tap** instead |
| Touch | **CST816** over I²C: SDA=11, SCL=12, INT=9, RST=10 |
| Haptics | DRV2605 LRA driver @ I²C 0x5A |
| Audio | PCM5100A I²S DAC + MEMS mic (not used by this firmware) |
| Flashing cable | **USB-A to USB-C data cable.** A C-to-C cable will not work: it negotiates plug orientation itself, which defeats the board's two-chip USB switch. A charge-only cable powers the board and enumerates nothing. |
| USB socket | One USB-C socket reaching two chips: the S3 in one orientation (`usbmodem*` / "USB JTAG/serial debug unit" — the one you flash), the companion in the other (`usbserial*`). Rotate the connector 180° in the dial's socket to switch. |

The current firmware ([`dial-idf`](dial-idf/)) is built on Waveshare's own
`ESP32-S3-Knob-Touch-LCD-1.8` ESP-IDF demo, whose display bring-up uses
Espressif's `esp_lcd_sh8601` component, and it boots and renders on real
hardware. An earlier prototype (the abandoned Moddable attempt, removed from
the tree — see this repo's git history) was written against a different
assumption — that this exact board used an **ST77916** controller, reserving
SH8601 for a separate 1.85" AMOLED variant. That assumption predates having
Waveshare's own demo in hand; the panel this firmware ships against is
confirmed driven via the SH8601 command set, not ST77916. If you're bringing
up a unit and LVGL renders garbage, that's the first thing to double check
against your specific board revision.
